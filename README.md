# ThriftPark 🚗💰

A real-time cost-effective parking web application that helps drivers in Singapore save money by identifying cheaper public carparks near retail and entertainment spaces.

## 📋 Problem Statement

In Singapore, parking at shopping malls, retail hubs, and popular landmarks is often expensive, even for short stays. A 1-hour parking session at a mall can cost several times more than nearby HDB or public carparks. The cost difference adds up significantly for frequent drivers, such as food delivery riders or young professionals who drive daily. Many users are unaware of cheaper alternatives located within a short walking distance, resulting in unnecessary expenses.

## 💡 Core Idea

ThriftPark integrates multiple Singapore Government datasets from data.gov.sg to help drivers make smarter, more cost-effective parking decisions:

### Data Sources
- **Carpark Availability API** (Housing & Development Board)
- **HDB Carpark Information** (Housing & Development Board)
- **URA Parking Lot GEOJSON** (Urban Redevelopment Authority)
- **JTC Carpark Information** (JTC Corporation)
- **Carpark Rates** (Land Transport Authority)

### Key Features
- 🅿️ Suggest nearby carparks within walking distance of popular malls and landmarks
- 📊 Show real-time lot availability for quick, informed decisions
- 💵 Provide a parking rate calculator to estimate fees based on duration
- 📈 Track user savings and show how much they save with each recommended public carpark
- 🎮 Gamification elements to motivate smarter financial decisions

## 🎯 Target Audience

- **Budget-conscious drivers** who want to save on parking costs
- **Food delivery drivers** who park frequently near malls/restaurants and need affordable short-term options
- **Young drivers** who are more cost-sensitive (students, first-jobbers)
- **Middle-aged drivers** who want to track and optimize long-term savings

## 🌟 Value Proposition & Unique Selling Points

ThriftPark reduces drivers' parking expenses while creating awareness of hidden, under-utilized public carparks, making city travel more cost-efficient. Users will see meaningful savings tracked via their personal dashboard, earn badges, and join a network of like-minded drivers contributing to smarter and more sustainable urban mobility practices.
