Project Introduction 
1: Problem Context 
In Singapore, parking at shopping malls, retail hubs and popular landmarks is often 
expensive, even for short stays. For example, a 1-hour parking session at a mall can 
cost several times more than a nearby HDB or public carparks. The cost difference 
adds up significantly for frequent drivers, such as food delivery riders or young 
professionals who drive daily. Many of these users are unaware of cheaper 
alternatives located within a short walking distance, resulting in unnecessary 
expenses.  
2: Core Idea 
This project proposes a real-time cost-effective parking web application, ThriftPark, 
that helps drivers save money by identifying cheaper public carparks near retail and 
entertainment spaces. The system integrates Singapore Government Datasets 
obtained from data.gov.sg, which include:  
● Carpark Availability API (Housing & Development Board) 
● HDB Carpark Information (Housing & Development Board) 
● URA Parking Lot GEOJSON (Urban Redevelopment Authority) 
● JTC Carpark Information (JTC Corporation) 
● Carpark Rates (Land Transport Authority) 
This data will be used in order to achieve the following broader goals: 
● Suggest nearby carparks within walking distance of popular malls and 
landmarks 
● Show real-time lot availability so users can make quick, informed choices 
● Provide a parking rate calculator to estimate parking fees based on user 
duration, and 
● Track user savings, showing how much they save each time you choose a 
recommended public carpark.  
By also inculcating gamification, the system motivates drivers to make smarter 
financial decisions while also alleviating demand for overcrowded mall carparks.  
3: Target Audience 
This application will look into serving the following target users: 
● Budget-conscious drivers who want to save on parking costs. 
● Food delivery drivers who park frequently near malls/restaurants and need 
affordable short-term options. 
● Young drivers who are more cost-sensitive such as students or first-jobbers. 
● Middle-aged drivers who want to track and optimise long-term savings. 
A4: Value Proposition & Unique Selling Points (USPs) 
ThriftPark not only reduces drivers’ parking expenses but also creates awareness of 
hidden, under-utilised public carparks, making city travel more cost-efficient. Over 
time, users will see meaningful savings, tracked via their personal dashboard, feel a 
sense of gratification from the badges they earn and be a part of an established 
network of likeminded drivers, contributing to a smarter and more sustainable nation 
powered by urban mobility practices.  
ThriftPark brings several unique benefits that current apps do not presently offer: 
● Savings-first mindset: unlike many parking apps that focus primarily on 
availability, this app puts savings at the core, showing users exactly how 
much they save by choosing public carparks over mall/private carparks. 
● Real-time recommendation engine: ThriftPark doesn’t just use static 
information, but also combines availability, price and proximity to suggest the 
cheapest viable carpark nearby in real-time. It also uses analytics to adjust 
dynamically based on the user’s vehicle type, time of day and parking 
duration. 
● Community-focused engagement: the badges, milestones and leaderboards 
showcase the savings achievements of our users, and creates a friendly 
competition, while the opportunity to network and learn from each other 
through the drivers’ forum creates a community of smart-savers unlike 
transactional applications.  
● Multi-dataset integration: ThriftPark aggregates data from several datasets 
and APIs such as carpark availability, HDB, URA and JTC carparks to 
produce richer insights and results that are all-comprehensive that most 
existing apps. 
● Savings Dashboard & Insights: the personalised dashboard tracks money 
saved over time, frequently used carparks and cost trends, which helps users 
reflect on their behaviour and plan smarter routes. 
We have also come up with an analysis of ThriftPark with its potential competitors, 
including Parkopedia, LTA Parking.sg and ParkMobile.
